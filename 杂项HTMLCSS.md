## How to make overflow not exceed parents element's padding

Issue:

- CSS `overflow: hidden` makes the child element hide after overflowing the parent element
- But the padding is part of the parent element, so overflow into the padding does not count as overflow parent element
- Thus overflow will not hide in padding

Solution:

- Wrap it with another element and make that element `overflow: hidden`
- The original parent element padding will be apply to the wrap element, and - the inner element won't exceed the wrap element
